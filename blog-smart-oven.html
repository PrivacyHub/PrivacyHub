                <h2>What Data Do They Collect?</h2>
                <p>Smart ovens and appliances track usage patterns, cooking schedules, recipe preferences, and app activity. Some record Wi-Fi information and device IDs. Advanced models may include cameras to monitor food cooking, track what you're cooking, and suggest recipes based on your habits. This creates a detailed picture of your eating habits, cooking skills, and daily routines.</p>

                <h2>How Do They Track Habits?</h2>
                <p>They monitor when and how appliances are used. Some devices sync with apps to suggest recipes or control settings remotely. Smart refrigerators may track what's inside, when items expire, and your shopping habits. Smart ovens record cooking times, temperatures, and preferred settings. Over time, these devices can predict when you typically cook, what you like to eat, and even your dietary patterns.</p>

                <div class="risk-box">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color: var(--accent-red);"></i> What Are the Risks?</h3>
                    <p>Usage data may reveal daily routines with precision: when you wake up (coffee maker), when you're home for lunch, what you eat, and when you cook dinner. Data could be shared with app developers or advertisers for targeted marketing (imagine ads for recipes based on what you cook). Hackers may gain control if devices are not secure, potentially causing safety hazards. Smart fridge cameras could reveal private moments in your kitchen. Food consumption data could be used by insurance companies or employers.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Types of Data Collected:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Patterns:</strong> When and how often appliances are used</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooking Schedules:</strong> Times of day you typically prepare meals</li>
                    <li><strong>Recipe Preferences:</strong> What recipes you search for or cook frequently</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Settings:</strong> Preferred cooking temperatures and modes</li>
                    <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> How you control appliances remotely</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera Images:</strong> Some ovens and fridges have interior cameras</li>
                    <li><strong>Shopping Lists:</strong> Items you add through connected apps</li>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi Information:</strong> Network details and connection status</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt" style="color: var(--success-green);"></i> How to Protect Privacy</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords:</strong> Secure your appliance accounts with complex passwords and never reuse them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit app permissions:</strong> Review what data the app can access on your phone and disable unnecessary permissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimize cloud connections:</strong> If an appliance works without cloud connectivity, consider using it locally only.</li>
                        <li><strong>Update firmware regularly:</strong> Keep appliance software updated for security patches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disconnect features you don't need:</strong> If you don't use remote control or recipe suggestions, disable these features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cover cameras:</strong> If your appliance has interior cameras, consider covering or disabling them when not needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Review data sharing settings:</strong> In the app, opt out of any data sharing with third parties.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a separate IoT network:</strong> Isolate smart appliances on a guest network to limit access to your main devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be careful with voice control:</strong> If your oven integrates with smart speakers, review what voice data is collected.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h2>Smart Refrigerator Concerns</h2>
                <p>Smart fridges with interior cameras can see exactly what food you have, when you're running low, and potentially your eating habits. Some models can identify items automatically. Consider whether you need this feature, and be aware that these images may be stored in the cloud. If you have a camera-enabled fridge, be mindful of what's visible when you open the door.</p>
                
                <h2>The Future of Kitchen Data</h2>
                <p>As kitchen appliances become smarter, they generate more data about our most private moments. Meal preparation is often a family activity, and data from these devices could reveal intimate details about household dynamics, dietary restrictions, and even health conditions. Consider the long-term implications before connecting every kitchen device to the internet.</p>
